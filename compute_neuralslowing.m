function neural_slowing = compute_neuralslowing(patient_data,control_data,freqs)

%PURPOSE:           Compute neural slowing as in: "A sagittal gradient of pathological and compensatory effects of neurophysiological slowing in Parkinsonâ€™s disease" (Wiesman et al., 2022)
%
%REQUIRED INPUTS:   patient_data: array of data for patient participants - dimensions: locations (e.g., vertices or ROIs) x participants x frequency samples (averaged over relevant frequency bands, if applicable)
%                   control_data: array of data for control/reference participants - dimensions: locations x participants x frequency samples
%                   freqs: center frequencies (in Hz) of frequency samples (1xN vector; for fitting the linear slope of z per Hz model)
%
%OUTPUTS:           neural_slowing: neural slowing indices (i.e., slopes) for each patient per location - dimensions: location x patient
